# jasmine-testing-project
Project realized during the Udacity Front-End Nano Degree

The goal is learn and ensure a program work correctly and do what we expect him to do. For this purpose we have use Jasmine a testing JavaScript framework.

To write the testing code is necessary to use the file **feedreader.js** that we can find in the following path 
jasmine\spec\feedreader.js. Also we can find all the files of the Jasmine framework inside the folder jasmine.

And to run the aplication the only thing we need to do is execute the file **index.html** inside the current project. If all testing pass the Jasmine will show messages of the test in a green color otherwise in red color.

**TESTS PERFORMED:**
