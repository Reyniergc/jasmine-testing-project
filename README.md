# jasmine-testing-project
Project realized during the Udacity Front-End Nano Degree

The goal of this project is to learn and ensure the program works correctly and does what we expect it to do.
For this purpose we have used Jasmine a testing JavaScript framework.

To write the testing code it is necessary to use the file **feedreader.js** that we can find in the following path 
jasmine\spec\feedreader.js. Also we can find all the files of the Jasmine framework inside the folder jasmine.

To run the aplication the only thing we need to do is execute the file **index.html** inside the current project. 
If all the testings pass Jasmine will show messages of the tests in a green color otherwise in red color.

**_In this link you can execute the test directly if you want._** [Test Now!!!](https://reyniergc.github.io/jasmine-testing-project/)
